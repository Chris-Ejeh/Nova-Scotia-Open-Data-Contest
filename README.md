# Nova-Scotia-Open-Data-Contest

Frontend software developed for the Nova Scotia Open Data Contest 2021

The Province of Nova Scotia is holding its fifth annual Open Data Contest in conjunction with International Open Data Day (March 6, 2021).

The Objective was to develop a working App that is innovative, easy-to-use, and has the potential to benefit Nova Scotia citizens or businesses in a Covid environment. The App must use at least one dataset from the Nova Scotia Open Data Portal and be able to demonstrate it’s benefit to Nova Scotians and relevance to an active pandemic. The App can have broad application in any area such as tourism, education, heath and wellness, economic development, community and lifestyle.

The solution will be judged based on the: • Value proposition (to citizens, business, or government) • Feasibility and usefulness • Creativity and innovation • Ease of use and esthetics
